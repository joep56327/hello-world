# hello-world
This is my README file for the Github tutorial exercise.
I'm Joe, a retired Microsoft marketing guy spending time finally working on a longtime desire to learn about Linux. 
After joining a local Linux Users Group, I had to download a few docs from someone's github repository. 
So, having never heard of github, here I am learning about that, too.
